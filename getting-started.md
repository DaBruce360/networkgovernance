# Getting started

This is a quick guide to submitting governance action proposals for voting on by Swarm Members. To submit a proposal for balloting, you need to be a Swarm Member.

1. **Talk about it**. Present your idea and put it out to the community for discussion and to get feedback on it. Telegram, Reddit and Discourse are good places to start.
2. **Iterate**. Based on feedback, develop your idea until you feel it is solid enough to formulate into a coherent proposal, with clear benefits and budget implications.
3. **Finalise a proposal**. While you’re getting feedback from Members, or when you’re ready, start formally documenting your idea. You can use a template as a guide for how to structure your proposal.
4. **Submit a ballot**: To enter the Swarm Network Voting Queue, submit your proposal to Github as a ballot and stake a minimum of two hundred and fifty \(250\) SWM tokens.
5. **Get support**: Other Members can stake against your proposal. Every two months, the top five most supported ballots, by stake, are selected to be voted on. Go out there and campaign.
6. **Vote!**: Read up on all upcoming ballots, talk to their sponsors, and don’t forget to vote. Every SWM token holder can vote on every ballot.
