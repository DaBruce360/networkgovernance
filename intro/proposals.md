# Proposals

A proposal starts as an idea that originates in the Swarm community. If it is felt there is enough ‘backing’ for the proposal, any Member can initiate a “Governance Action Proposal” or “GAP”, providing a detailed description of the action, any relevant supporting documentation, and may include a request for a budget. A GAP should describe to Members how the action benefits the Swarm Network and why they should vote for it.
