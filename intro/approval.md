# Approval

Each SWM token grants its holder one vote in any referendum. A quorum for a referendum exists if the number of votes cast in the referendum represent 25% of the outstanding SWM tokens. Failure to reach a quorum results in a failed Governance Action.

Approved Governance Actions are reviewed by the Swarm Council, which puts in place any procedures, or takes the necessary actions to execute them.
