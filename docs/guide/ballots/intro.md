### Governance Action Ballots
All governance actions ballots (GABs) start life as a proposal (GAP) that has been discussed to the point where a Member feels it beneficial to formalize and submit it to the voting queue to be voted on by the community of Members. The Swarm Network Constitution stipulates the procedural and substantive requirements a GAP needs to meet. These ensure that proposals are considered thoughtfully and that they describe the intended action sufficiently for voters to make an informed decision.
