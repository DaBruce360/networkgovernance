# Governance Action Voting Process

## Introduction

* Swarm Network Governance consists of three components: Proposals, Ballots and Actions.
* Any member can initiate a proposal.
* To promote a proposal to a ballot and be eligible to enter the voting queue, the ballot sponsor must deposit a stake of SWM tokens. Other Members can co-sponsor the ballot by staking additional SWM, which gives the ballot a higher priority. 
* Every two months, the five most supported ballots are voted on by eligible members in a referendum.
* Each SWM token grants its holder the right to cast one vote in any referendum.
* Liquid Democracy: Votes can be delegated to others.
* Winning ballots become actions to be executed by the Swarm Council.
